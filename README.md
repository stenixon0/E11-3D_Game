This game is a 3D platformer where the player is a ball.

I changed the player input to affect acceleration, rather than velocity.

When the player is not inputting a direction, the "friction" will bring the ball to a halt.

Note that input can still occur when the player ball is in the air

The movement was intended to mirror what a ball rolling platformer would be like, without all of the complicated collisions.


The goal is the green hole, intended to look like a golf hole.

There are Three levels in all

# I did not program an out of bounds so if you fall off you will have to restart the program.

Thanks for Playing!
